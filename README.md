# bank-simulation-program-in-c
just a simple bank simulation that I did as a school project.
Im aware that I've swaped meanings of "account" and "bill". Account is supposed to be just a profile and each profile is able to have up to
20 "bills" or accounts.

still a lot to implement:


Basic:

writeMeny - done

add new account - done

show all accounts

search account by ID - done

change data of an Account

delete account

transactions


Advanced:

search account by Name/Adress/ID_bill/JMBG.  Yes this will display more than 1 account!

make english translation of a program
