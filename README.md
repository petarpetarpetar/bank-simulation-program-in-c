# bank-simulation-program-in-c
just a simple bank simulation that I did as a school project.
Im aware that I've swaped meanings of "account" and "bill". Account is supposed to be just a profile and each profile is able to have up to
20 "bills" or accounts.

still a lot to implement:


## Basic:

- [x] writeMeny

- [x] add new account

- [x] show all accounts

- [x] search account by ID

- [ ] change data of an Account

- [x] delete account 

- [x] add a bill to a account 

- [ ] transactions


## Advanced:

search account by Name/Adress/ID_bill/JMBG.  Yes this will display more than 1 account!
